How to set up the RaspberryPi is described in the [main README.md](https://github.com/ValentinBhend/Ballmaze/blob/main/README.md#raspberrypi-setup) <br>

**Some remarks**
- I had problems with my router, so I connected it to my phone mobile-hotspot instead. This also makes it portable. It is also possible to connect the Pi and PC over USB but the setpu is a bit more tedious than SSH over Wi-Fi.
- On a RaspberryPi Zero, the camera port / CSI slot is very fragile. After breaking two, I glued the cable into the port. I might try designing a 3D printed part to make it more robust.
