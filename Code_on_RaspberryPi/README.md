How to set up the RaspberryPi is described in the [main README.md](https://github.com/ValentinBhend/Ballmaze/blob/main/README.md#raspberrypi-setup) <br>

**Some remarks**
- To setup the RaspberryPi, SSH over a local Wi-Fi is somewhat convenient. But I had lags of up to 200ms, so I switched to a wired connection (ethernet) later on. 
- On a RaspberryPi Zero, the camera port / CSI slot is very fragile. After breaking two, I glued the cable into the port. I might try designing a 3D printed part to make it more robust.
