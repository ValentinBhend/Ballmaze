This project is showcased in ...add link to yt-video/channel...

The goal is to automize playing the ballmaze dexterity game. There are quite a few challanges in this and a lot of things can be improved from the current solution.

### Want to build one yourself?

I'll try my best to give some instructions here, but some previous experience with a RaspberryPi or similar and a little experience in programming in python would surely help :) And of couse a great interest in robotics/machine learning <br>
In total the materials cost about 50 - 90$/€ depending on whether you or someone you know has a 3D printer or you order the parts from somewhere. 

#### List of materials
Most parts can be replaced by similar ones or whatever you might already have.
